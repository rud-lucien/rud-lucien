keayboard shortcut for Command Pallet: Ctrl + Shift + P

to split vscode workspace for dual monitors do as follows:

    acces the Command Pallet with Ctrl + Shift + P

    search for Workspaces: Duplicate as Workspace in New Window and select it

    This will open a new window that is associated with the current workspace. This is useful so I can have Copilot full screen so I can prompt it as I code.

    Note! The thing to keep in mind is that it just DUPLICATED the existing workspace in a new window. Notice that at the top of the EXPLORER it will say UNTITLED (WORKSPACE). You can now work with two windows editing your code, but when you quit out of VSCode close the duplicate workspace first. It will ask you to save the workspace. You can tell it to close without saving.
