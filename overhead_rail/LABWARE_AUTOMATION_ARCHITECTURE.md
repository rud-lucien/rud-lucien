# Labware Automation Architecture

## üéØ **Overview**

This document defines the complete architecture for automated labware handling commands in the overhead rail system. The design focuses on **simplicity, safety, and reliability** through intelligent automation with minimal user decision-making.

---

## üìã **Command Structure**

### **Primary Commands**

#### **1. `goto` Command - Automated Pickup/Delivery**
```
goto <location> <labware-status>
```

**Examples:**
- `goto WC1 no-labware` - Go to WC1 for pickup operation
- `goto WC2 with-labware` - Go to WC2 for delivery operation
- `goto WC3 no-labware` - Go to WC3 for pickup operation

#### **2. `labware` Command - State Management**
```
labware <action>
```

**Sub-commands:**
- `labware status` - Display current labware tracking state
- `labware audit` - Automatically validate and fix labware state
- `labware reset` - Clear all labware tracking (nuclear option)

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Labware State Tracking**

#### **Rail 1 (Long Rail ~8m) - Checkpoint-Based Tracking**
```cpp
struct Rail1LabwareState {
    bool hasLabware;              // Current labware status
    Location lastKnownLocation;   // WC1, WC2, or HANDOFF
    Location labwareSource;       // Where did this labware originate?
    bool validated;               // Confirmed by sensor reading?
    bool uncertainDueToFault;     // State uncertain after fault?
    unsigned long lastValidated;  // Timestamp of last sensor confirmation
};
```

**Available Sensors:** WC1, WC2, Rail1-Handoff (fixed position sensors)

#### **Rail 2 (Short Rail) - Continuous Tracking**
```cpp
struct Rail2LabwareState {
    bool hasLabware;              // Real-time sensor reading
    Location labwareSource;       // Where did this labware originate?
    unsigned long lastValidated;  // Always current (continuous sensor)
};
```

**Available Sensors:** Carriage-mounted (always knows state)

#### **Global System State**
```cpp
struct SystemLabwareState {
    Rail1LabwareState rail1;
    Rail2LabwareState rail2;
    bool automationEnabled;       // Can execute goto commands?
    bool dualLabwareConflict;     // Both rails have labware?
};
```

---

## üöÄ **`goto` Command Implementation**

### **Command Processing Flow**

#### **1. Command Parsing**
```cpp
goto <location> <labware-status>
```
- **Location**: WC1, WC2, WC3, handoff
- **Labware Status**: `no-labware` (pickup) or `with-labware` (delivery)

#### **2. Operation Type Detection**
```cpp
if (labware_status == "no-labware") {
    operation = PICKUP;
} else if (labware_status == "with-labware") {
    operation = DELIVERY;
}
```

#### **3. Rail Selection Logic**

**For Pickup Operations (`no-labware`):**
- **WC1/WC2** ‚Üí Rail 1 (only rail that can reach these locations)
- **WC3** ‚Üí Rail 2 (only rail that can reach this location)

**For Delivery Operations (`with-labware`):**
- **Check which rail has labware** ‚Üí Use that rail
- **Validate destination is reachable** by the rail with labware
- **Error if no rail has labware** or **multiple rails have labware**

#### **4. Pre-Movement Validation**

**Pickup Operations:**
```cpp
1. Verify destination has labware (sensor check)
2. Verify selected rail is empty (state check)
3. Verify rail can reach destination (geometry check)
4. Verify no dual labware conflict
```

**Delivery Operations:**
```cpp
1. Verify source rail has labware (state check)
2. Verify destination is empty (sensor check when possible)
3. Verify source rail can reach destination (geometry check)
4. Resolve dual labware conflicts
```

#### **5. Movement Execution**

**Pickup Flow:**
```cpp
1. Move to destination at no-labware speeds
2. Arrive and confirm labware presence (sensor)
3. Report "READY_FOR_PICKUP" status
4. Wait for labware loading (manual or automated)
5. Update state: rail.hasLabware = true, rail.labwareSource = destination
6. Report "PICKUP_COMPLETE"
```

**Delivery Flow:**
```cpp
1. Move to destination at with-labware speeds
2. Arrive and confirm labware still present on carriage
3. Complete delivery (manual or automated)
4. Confirm labware transferred to destination (sensor when available)
5. Update state: rail.hasLabware = false
6. Report "DELIVERY_COMPLETE"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling & Recovery**

### **Error Categories**

#### **1. Pre-Movement Errors (Immediate Rejection)**

**Dual Labware Conflict:**
```
ERROR: DUAL_LABWARE_CONFLICT
- Rail 1: HAS_LABWARE (from WC1)
- Rail 2: HAS_LABWARE (from WC3)
- Cannot execute delivery - multiple sources available
- Resolution: Complete one delivery before starting another
```

**No Labware Available:**
```
ERROR: NO_LABWARE_AVAILABLE
- Rail 1: NO_LABWARE
- Rail 2: NO_LABWARE
- Cannot deliver to WC2 - no source labware
- Resolution: Execute pickup operation first
```

**Unreachable Destination:**
```
ERROR: UNREACHABLE_DESTINATION
- Rail 1 has labware but cannot reach WC3
- Rail 2 has no labware to deliver
- Resolution: Transfer via handoff or deliver Rail 1 labware elsewhere
```

#### **2. Movement Faults (Recovery Required)**

**Motor Fault During Movement:**
```
FAULT_DETECTED: Motor fault during WC1‚ÜíWC2 movement
- Position: 4200mm (between destinations)
- Labware Status: UNCERTAIN
- Recovery Options:
  1. labware audit  - Automatic sensor validation
  2. labware reset  - Clear state and start fresh
```

**E-Stop During Movement:**
```
ESTOP_RECOVERY_NEEDED: E-stop activated during delivery
- Last Known: Moving to WC2 with labware
- Current Status: STOPPED at unknown position
- Labware Status: UNCERTAIN
- Recovery Required: Use 'labware audit' after E-stop cleared
```

### **Recovery Strategies**

#### **Smart Recovery: `labware audit`**

**Process:**
```cpp
1. Check Rail 1 current position
2. Calculate nearest safe sensor location (WC1 or WC2 only)
3. Move to sensor location at with-labware speeds (conservative)
4. Read sensor and determine actual labware state
5. Update system state based on sensor reality
6. Clear uncertainty flags
7. Report validated state and enable automation
```

**Example Flow:**
```
LABWARE_AUDIT_INITIATED: Analyzing Rail 1 position and state
MOVING_TO_WC2_FOR_VALIDATION: Nearest sensor location (using safe speeds)
ARRIVED_AT_WC2: Reading labware sensor
SENSOR_READING_COMPLETE: Labware detected at WC2
LABWARE_STATE_UPDATED: Rail 1 has labware at WC2 (sensor confirmed)
AUDIT_COMPLETE: System ready for automation commands
```

**Safety Features:**
- **Always moves at with-labware speeds** (protects potential labware)
- **Only moves to WC1/WC2** (avoids handoff collision zone)
- **Uses actual sensor readings** (ground truth validation)
- **Updates all tracking state** (comprehensive recovery)

#### **Nuclear Recovery: `labware reset`**

**Process:**
```cpp
1. Clear all labware tracking state
2. Mark all rail states as UNKNOWN
3. Disable automation until audit complete
4. Require manual state establishment
5. Log reset event for debugging
```

**Example Flow:**
```
NUCLEAR_RESET_INITIATED: Clearing all labware tracking state
LABWARE_STATE_CLEARED: All rails marked as unknown
AUTOMATION_DISABLED: Manual rail commands only until audit
SYSTEM_REQUIRES_AUDIT: Use 'labware audit' to establish current state
RESET_COMPLETE: Ready for manual operation or audit
```

## üîß **State Validation & Sensor Integration**

### **Sensor Validation Points**

#### **Rail 1 Checkpoint Validation:**
- **WC1 Sensor**: Validates labware presence/absence during operations
- **WC2 Sensor**: Validates labware presence/absence during operations
- **Handoff Sensor**: Used during Rail 1‚ÜîRail 2 transfers only

#### **Rail 2 Continuous Validation:**
- **Carriage Sensor**: Real-time labware presence (high confidence)
- **WC3 Sensor**: Validates pickup/delivery operations
- **Handoff Sensor**: Cross-validates transfers with Rail 1

### **Confidence Levels**
```cpp
enum ConfidenceLevel {
    HIGH,     // Rail 2 carriage sensor, recent sensor reading
    MEDIUM,   // Rail 1 at sensor checkpoint
    LOW,      // Rail 1 between checkpoints (inferred state)
    UNKNOWN   // State uncertain due to fault/reset
};
```

### **State Update Triggers**
1. **Successful movement completion** at sensor locations
2. **Sensor readings** during operations
3. **Manual audit commands** with sensor validation
4. **Cross-rail validation** during handoff operations
5. **Fault recovery** with sensor confirmation

---

## üìä **User Experience & Messaging**

### **Status Reporting**

#### **`labware status` Output:**
```
LABWARE_SYSTEM_STATUS: Current tracking state
============================================
Rail 1: HAS_LABWARE (from WC1, validated at WC2) - confidence: MEDIUM
Rail 2: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed) - confidence: HIGH
WC1: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed)
WC2: HAS_LABWARE (sensor confirmed)  
WC3: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed)

System Status: READY for automation
Last Validation: 14:32:15 (2 minutes ago)
```

#### **During Uncertain State:**
```
LABWARE_SYSTEM_STATUS: Recovery required
========================================
Rail 1: UNCERTAIN (fault during WC1‚ÜíWC2 movement) - confidence: UNKNOWN
Rail 2: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed) - confidence: HIGH
WC1: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed)
WC2: UNKNOWN (destination of interrupted delivery)
WC3: NO_LABWARE (sensor confirmed)

System Status: AUTOMATION_DISABLED
Recovery Options:
- labware audit  (recommended: automatic sensor validation)
- labware reset  (nuclear option: clear all state)
```

### **Operation Messaging**

#### **Successful Operations:**
```
> goto WC1 no-labware
PICKUP_OPERATION_INITIATED: Moving Rail 1 to WC1 for labware pickup
MOVING_TO_WC1: Using no-labware speeds
ARRIVED_AT_WC1: Labware detected, ready for pickup
LABWARE_PICKUP_READY: Manual loading or automated pickup can proceed
(after pickup)
PICKUP_COMPLETE: Rail 1 now has labware from WC1
```

#### **Error Messages:**
```
> goto WC3 with-labware
ERROR: DUAL_LABWARE_CONFLICT
- Rail 1: HAS_LABWARE (from WC1)
- Rail 2: HAS_LABWARE (from WC3)
- Cannot execute delivery - multiple sources available
- Suggestion: Complete one delivery before starting another
- Use 'labware status' to see current state
```

2. **Implement `performLabwareAudit()`**:
   - Move to nearest sensor location
   - Read actual sensor state  
   - Update tracking based on ground truth
   - Handle uncertainty resolution
3. **Enhance `printLabwareSystemStatus()`**: Show real tracking state, confidence levels
4. **Add state persistence**: Maintain state across operations

**Result**: Full labware state tracking and audit recovery functional

#### **Phase 7: Advanced Preflight Validation (MOST CHALLENGING - 4 hours)**
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive operation validation
1. **Enhance `performGotoPreflightChecks()`**:
   - Check for dual labware conflicts
   - Validate pickup/delivery logic consistency
   - Cross-reference sensor states
   - Collision zone analysis
2. **Add operation-specific validation**:
   - Pickup operations: Verify labware present at destination
   - Delivery operations: Verify rail has labware, destination is clear
3. **Implement error recovery suggestions**: Context-specific guidance
4. **Add comprehensive logging**: Full audit trail

**Result**: Production-ready automated labware handling with full safety validation

### **üéØ Recommended Starting Point**

**Begin with Phase 1** - it will give you immediate functional improvements:
```bash
# First session goals (30 minutes):
1. Create LabwareAutomation.h with basic Location enum
2. Implement getLocationName() helper function  
3. Implement clearLabwareState() placeholder
4. Implement basic printLabwareSystemStatus()
5. Test: labware status, labware reset, labware help
```

This approach ensures steady progress with working functionality at each step, making it easy to pick up development at any phase boundary.
